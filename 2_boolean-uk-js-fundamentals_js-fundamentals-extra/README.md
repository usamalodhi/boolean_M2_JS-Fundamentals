# JS Fundamentals Extra

This repo contains additional exercises for those that have completed the js-fundamentals repository but wish to continue practicing. 

### Setup

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account
2. Clone your forked repository to your machine
3. Change directory into the project.
4. Install the project dependencies

```sh
$ npm install
```

### Instructions
The set up and process is the same as for js-fundamentals, but here all exercises are inside a single source file and spec file. Start by running the tests. Open up the project in VS Code, start a new terminal (Terminal -> New from the menu) then run the npx jasmine command:

```sh
$ npx jasmine --fail-fast=true spec/js-fundamentals-extra.spec.js
```

Inspect this output. Your output might be slightly different. Read through this, and focus on one test at a time. Get the tests to pass by editing the source file located in the src directory.
